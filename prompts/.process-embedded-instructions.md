# Document Revision with Embedded Instructions

## CONTEXT

We are revising an INPUT TEXT that contains embedded instructions that are to be processed, leading to an OUTPUT TEXT.

## TASKS

Execute the following steps on the INPUT TEXT:
1. **Understand the text**: Start by thoroughly reviewing the text to understand its ideas, purpose, and context. This ensures that the modifications align with the overall goals and message of the document.
2. **Execute instructions**: Execute the embedded instructions in the attached text according to the below RULES FOR EMBEDDED INSTRUCTIONS. Continue processing until no more instructions can be executed.
3. **Output result**: Output the resulting text as a markdown document that I can download.

## RULES FOR EMBEDDED INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Enclosure**: An instruction is enclosed with double curly braces, e.g., `{{instruction}}`.
2. **HTML Comments**: An instruction must not be executed if it is enclosed in an HTML comment, e.g., `<!-- {{instruction}} -->`.
3. **Dependency on Other Texts**:
    - If the execution of an instruction uses text elsewhere in the document, e.g., `{{rewrite the following paragraphs using an academic style}}` or `{{summarize the previous 3 paragraphs}}`, then the instruction may not be executed if such texts contain embedded instructions that are not enclosed in comments.
4. **Explicit Mention for Tagged Instructions**: An instruction of the form `{{tag: details}}` (where `tag` is a sequence of characters without spaces followed by a colon) is processed if and only if there is an explicit mention in the prompt of what to do with the tag. If there is no explicit mention, the instruction should be ignored.
5. **Processing Non-Tagged Instructions**: Embedded instructions that do not start with a tag followed by a colon, such as `{{provide a summary of the above text}}`, should be executed based on their natural language meaning and the context provided in the text.
6. **Post-Execution Commenting**: After an instruction has been executed, it must be enclosed in HTML comments so that we can see it has been processed. So, after executing `{{instruction}}`, it should then read `<!-- {{instruction}} -->`.
7. **Multiple Passes**: Processing a piece of text may consist of multiple passes, where each pass executes the embedded instructions that qualify for execution. The resulting text is then reprocessed, allowing the execution of embedded instructions that in the previous pass could not be executed because they depend on texts that contained embedded instructions that have been executed in that previous pass.
8. **Termination**: Processing terminates when the text does not contain embedded instructions that can be processed.

## EXPLICIT TAGS

- **{{rewrite: details}}**: Rewrite the specified sections based on the details provided.
- **{{summarize: details}}**: Summarize the specified sections based on the details provided.
- **{{format: details}}**: Adjust the formatting of the specified sections based on the details provided.
