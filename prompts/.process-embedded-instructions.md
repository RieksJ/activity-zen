# Process Embedded Instructions

## CONTEXT

We are revising an INPUT TEXT that contains embedded instructions that are to be processed, leading to an OUTPUT TEXT.

## TASKS

Execute the following steps on the INPUT TEXT:
1. **Understand the text**: Start by thoroughly reviewing the text to understand its ideas, purpose, and context. This ensures that the modifications align with the overall goals and message of the document.
2. **Execute instructions**: Execute the embedded instructions in the attached text according to the below RULES FOR EMBEDDED INSTRUCTIONS. Continue processing until no more instructions can be executed.
3. **Output result**: Output the resulting text as a markdown document that I can download.

## RULES FOR EMBEDDED INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Enclosure**: An embedded instruction is a text enclosed with double curly braces, e.g., `{{instruction}}`. A tagged instruction is a text of the form `tag: details` that is enclosed with double curly braces, e.g., `{{tag: details}}`. An untagged instruction is an embedded instruction that is not a tagged instruction.
2. **HTML Comments**: An embedded instruction must not be executed if it is enclosed in an HTML comment, e.g., `<!-- {{instruction}} -->`.
3. **Dependency on Other Texts**:
    - If the execution of an embedded instruction uses text elsewhere in the document, e.g., `{{rewrite: the next paragraph, using an academic style}}` or `{{summarize the previous 3 paragraphs}}`, then the embedded instruction may not be executed if such texts contain embedded instructions that are not enclosed in comments.
4. **Tag Lists**: A prompt can specify a section `## EXPLICIT TAGS`, that contains a list of which the entries specify how particular tagged instructions are to be executed, e.g., `**{{rewrite: details}}**: Rewrite the specified sections based on the details provided.` 
5. **Executing Tagged Instructions**: A tagged instruction, such as `{{rewrite: the next paragraph}}` is processed if and only if its tag appears in one of the tag lists that exists in any known prompt. If the tag occurs in the tag lists of multiple prompts, or it does not appear in any tag list, then the tagged instruction is ignored, and an Editors Note is added that states the cause of it being ignored.
6. **Executing Untagged Instructions**: An untagged instruction such as `{{provide a summary of the above text}}`, should be executed based on their natural language meaning and the context provided in the text.
7. **Post-Execution Commenting**: After an embedded instruction has been executed, it must be enclosed in HTML comments so that we can see it has been processed. So, after executing `{{instruction}}`, it should then read `<!-- {{instruction}} -->`. Embedded instructions that are ignored must not be enclosed in HTML comments.
8. **Multiple Passes**: Processing a piece of text may consist of multiple passes, where each pass executes the embedded instructions that qualify for execution. The resulting text is then reprocessed, allowing the execution of embedded instructions that in the previous pass could not be executed because they depend on texts that contained embedded instructions that have been executed in that previous pass.
9.  **Termination**: Processing terminates when the text does not contain embedded instructions that can be processed.

## EXPLICIT TAGS

- **{{rewrite: details}}**: Rewrite the specified sections based on the details provided.
- **{{summarize: details}}**: Summarize the specified sections based on the details provided.
- **{{format: details}}**: Adjust the formatting of the specified sections based on the details provided.
