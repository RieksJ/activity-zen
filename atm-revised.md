# Streamlining Task Management: The Activity Triage Method

## Abstract

In today's fast-paced and complex work environments, efficient task management is crucial for success. Many organizations and individuals struggle with identifying and prioritizing tasks effectively, leading to wasted resources and missed opportunities. This paper introduces the Activity Triage Method, a simple yet powerful approach to task management that focuses on clarifying objectives, identifying actual users, and ensuring tasks are fit for their intended purpose. By addressing common inefficiencies and cognitive biases, the method aims to enhance productivity and alignment with strategic goals. The paper outlines the problem, describes the method in detail, and provides practical guidance for implementation, supported by real-world examples and case studies.

## 1. Introduction

In many workplaces, people often find themselves engaged in tasks that do not seem to add much value. For example, employees might spend hours creating detailed reports that no one reads or participating in meetings that do not lead to actionable outcomes. While these activities might have 'good' reasons behind them, such as following company protocols or demonstrating diligence, they often result in inefficiency and frustration.

There is a pressing need for a method that helps individuals and organizations identify and focus on tasks that truly matter. The Activity Triage Method offers a structured approach to achieve this by asking three critical questions about any task: What are the concrete results? Who are the actual users? What will these users do with the results? By answering these questions, task objectives become clearer, and efforts are better aligned with meaningful outcomes.

This paper proposes the Activity Triage Method, which is designed to improve task clarity, relevance, and effectiveness. Implementing this method can help reduce wasted efforts, enhance productivity, and ensure that tasks contribute to strategic goals. However, it also requires a shift in mindset and careful consideration of each task's purpose and impact.

The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 outlines the common problems in task management and provides evidence of their prevalence. Section 3 introduces the Activity Triage Method in detail. Section 4 discusses the expected benefits of applying this method. Section 5 provides practical implementation guidelines, including a step-by-step guide and solutions to common challenges. Section 6 suggests strategies for encouraging adoption of the method, and Section 7 concludes the paper with a summary of key points and a call to action.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many organizations and individuals struggle with task management, often spending time on activities that do not yield tangible benefits. Common issues include vague task objectives, unclear target users, and a lack of understanding of the task's ultimate purpose. These inefficiencies can lead to wasted resources and missed opportunities.

Studies and surveys provide substantial evidence of these inefficiencies. The Project Management Institute found that poor project management, including unclear objectives, was a primary factor in 37% of project failures, underscoring the need for well-defined task goals to ensure success ([PMI, 2020](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/influences-project-failure-6225)). Similarly, the Standish Group's CHAOS Report revealed that only 29% of IT projects were successful, with many failures attributed to not clearly identifying end-users or their needs, resulting in products or solutions that do not meet user expectations ([Standish Group, 2020](https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/CHAOSReport2015-Final.pdf)).

Moreover, a survey by McKinsey & Company found that 70% of employees felt their work was not aligned with the company's strategic goals, indicating a widespread issue of tasks being carried out without a clear understanding of their purpose within the broader organizational context ([McKinsey & Company, 2018](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/the-organization-blog/aligning-employees-with-the-companys-strategic-goals)). Gartner reported that 20% of project budgets are typically wasted due to inefficiencies in task management and misalignment with project goals ([Gartner, 2019](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3873863/the-2019-gartner-project-management-benchmarks)). An article by Harvard Business Review highlights that organizations often miss out on strategic opportunities because they are bogged down with tasks that do not contribute to their long-term objectives ([Harvard Business Review, 2019](https://hbr.org/2019/03/why-so-many-strategic-initiatives-fail)). Additionally, Gallup found that only 35% of U.S. employees are engaged in their work, often due to a lack of clarity and purpose in their daily tasks, directly linked to unclear task objectives and misalignment with overall goals ([Gallup, 2020](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/321965/employee-engagement-holds-steady-first-half-2020.aspx)).

Despite knowing that certain tasks may be inefficient or ineffective, people often continue to engage in these activities due to a combination of cognitive limitations, biases, social influences, and organizational dynamics. Herbert Simon's concept of bounded rationality explains that individuals make decisions within the constraints of limited information and cognitive capabilities, often resulting in satisfactory rather than optimal choices ([Simon, 1955](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1884852)). Daniel Kahneman's research on cognitive biases reveals that people frequently rely on intuitive (System 1) thinking, which is prone to errors such as overconfidence, anchoring, and framing effects ([Kahneman, 2011](https://www.farrarstrausgiroux.com)). Piers Steel's work on procrastination indicates that individuals often delay or avoid tasks perceived as difficult or unpleasant, contributing to inefficiency ([Steel, 2007](https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.65)). Furthermore, Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert Sutton highlight the "knowing-doing gap," where organizations fail to translate knowledge into action due to lack of clear objectives, bureaucratic inertia, and misaligned incentives ([Pfeffer & Sutton, 2000](https://hbr.org/product/the-knowing-doing-gap-how-smart-companies-turn-knowledge-into-action/1408E-KND-ENG)). Social pressures and the desire to conform also play a significant role, as individuals may undertake tasks to align with perceived expectations rather than objective efficiency. These factors collectively explain why inefficiency and ineffectiveness persist in both individual and organizational behaviors.

## 3. The Activity Triage Method

The Activity Triage Method revolves around three core questions that are designed to clarify (and enhance) the purpose and scope of any task. Having answers to these questions helps to improve the quality of task specifications, task assignment and task execution, and gives individuals more confidence that their efforts are directed towards actually meaningful and productive outcomes.

The questions are as follows:

1. "**What are the <u>concrete results</u> of the task?**"
2. "**Which (groups of) individual people will <u>actually</u> be using these results?**"
3. "**What is it that these people will <u>actually be doing</u> with the results?**"

### 3.1. Concrete Results

Answers to the first question ("**What are the <u>concrete results</u> of the task?**") should identify the concrete artifacts that will exist when the task is done (and that did not exist at the start). They can be tangible artifacts, such as documents, reports, presentations, but also intangibles such as new ideas, or enjoyable memories.

Answers should identify concrete artifacts, the existence of which is verifiable (auditable). Creating 'a solid advice' may be the name of a task, but since the existence of 'a solid advice' isn't verifiable, it doesn't qualify as an answer to this question. 

Ideally, answers to this question also specify any verifiable (auditable) characteristics that the results are expected to have. For example, a report may require that a particular template be used, is written in a given language, have an appendix that contains a glossary of terms and/or abbreviations used, etc.

Having a good answer to the question of concrete results ensures that tasks are clearly defined and their outcomes are measurable. This clarity helps in setting realistic expectations and provides a clear benchmark for evaluating task completion. It also facilitates better communication among team members and stakeholders, as everyone understands what is expected. Conversely, when the answer does not meet the qualifications, there is a risk of ambiguity and misunderstanding, leading to wasted effort, misaligned objectives, and potentially unsuccessful task outcomes.

### 3.2. Actual Users

Answers to the second question ("**Which (groups of) individual people will <u>actually</u> be using these results?**") should list the names of the individuals that will be using the results, and/or the names of a group of people, such as "Members of Parliament", for which it is clear who is, and who is not, a member. We will use the term 'consumers (of a result)' to refer to the set of individuals that will actually be using that result.

Answers should not refer to groups of individuals for which it cannot be established who is, and who is not a part of the group. For example, "the customer" or "readers" are not useful as an answer.

Note that consumers are individuals that will <u>*actually*</u> be using the results. There may be many other individuals that might <u>*potentially*</u> use the results, but these are not considered consumers. 

Identifying the actual users of a task's results ensures that the task is tailored to the needs and expectations of those who will benefit from it. This specificity helps in designing tasks that are relevant and useful, increasing the likelihood of the results being effectively utilized. It also aids in prioritizing resources and efforts towards outcomes that have a clear and direct impact. On

 the other hand, if the answer is vague or inaccurate, there is a risk of creating results that are misaligned with user needs, leading to dissatisfaction, underutilization, and wasted resources.

### 3.3. Fit-for-Purposeness

Answers to the third question ("**What is it that these people will <u>actually be doing</u> with the results?**") list the activities of every (group of) consumers for which the result is necessary.

Ideally, answers to this question also elaborate on the particular characteristics of the results that make it particularly valuable for being used in specific activities. 

Understanding what users will do with the results ensures that the task outcomes are designed to be fit for their intended purpose. This alignment helps in creating results that are not only relevant but also functional and valuable for specific activities. It enhances the practical application of the results, ensuring they meet the users' needs effectively. If this question is not adequately answered, there is a risk of producing results that are impractical or irrelevant, reducing their utility and impact.

### 3.4. When and Where to Use the Method

These questions may be answered in a number of situations:
- Whenever a task is designed. By answering these questions, the designer of the task can ensure the task is well-defined, relevant, and aligned with user needs.
- Whenever a person is tasked with the execution of a task. By answering these questions, that person can clarify their objectives, understand the expectations, and focus their efforts on producing meaningful results.
- Whenever a person has been executing a task for some time (some tasks take a long time). By answering these questions, that person can reassess the task's direction, make necessary adjustments, and ensure continued alignment with the intended purpose.
- Whenever a task is being evaluated for efficiency and effectiveness. By answering these questions, the person that evaluates that task can measure its success, identify areas for improvement, and provide actionable feedback.

## 4. Expected Benefits of the Activity Triage Method

The Activity Triage Method is envisaged to provide several significant benefits by addressing common barriers to effective task management, as identified by Simon, Kahneman, Steel, and Pfeffer. By providing a clear framework for task evaluation, the method is expected to help individuals and organizations overcome cognitive limitations, biases, and organizational dynamics that lead to inefficiency.

Firstly, the method is anticipated to increase efficiency by ensuring tasks are clearly defined with concrete results. This clarity will help in setting realistic expectations and provide measurable benchmarks for evaluating task completion. It is expected to reduce ambiguity and misunderstanding, leading to better resource allocation and successful task outcomes.

Secondly, the method aims to improve communication by requiring precise identification of the actual users of the task's results. This specificity is likely to ensure that tasks are tailored to the needs of those who will benefit from them, facilitating better stakeholder engagement and collaboration. It should also help in prioritizing efforts towards outcomes that have a clear and direct impact.

Thirdly, the method is designed to enhance task relevance by focusing on the intended use of the results. Understanding what users will do with the results ensures that task outcomes are designed to be functional and valuable. This alignment is expected to increase the practical application of the results, ensuring they meet users' needs effectively.

Overall, the Activity Triage Method is expected to help individuals and organizations become more efficient, effective, and communicative by providing a structured approach to task evaluation and execution.
