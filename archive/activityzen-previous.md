{{write an abstract}}
 
## 1. Introduction

{{write the Introduction chapter, based on the content below. Start by introducing readily recognizable, real-world examples of people doing ineffective and/or inefficient things, and make it plausible that people typically have 'good' reasons to do that. Then, write some text that argues there is a need for the proposals we make in this paper. Next, write a paragraph that explicitly mentions these proposals, and the benefits (and drawbacks) that readers can experience when applying them. Finally, write a paragraph that explains the structure of this paper.}}

## 2. Problem Statement

{{rewrite this chapter so that it becomes more of a whole. I prefer if the numerous bullets go out, and you replace them with one or more paragraphs or text.}}

Many organizations and individuals struggle with task management, often spending time on activities that do not yield tangible benefits. Common issues include vague task objectives, unclear target users, and a lack of understanding of the task's ultimate purpose. These inefficiencies can lead to wasted resources and missed opportunities.

There is a lot of evidence for this, e.g.:

- A study by the Project Management Institute found that poor project management, including unclear objectives, was a primary factor in 37% of project failures. This highlights the critical need for well-defined task goals to ensure project success ([PMI, 2020](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/influences-project-failure-6225)).
- Research by the Standish Group in their CHAOS Report revealed that only 29% of IT projects were successful, with a significant number failing due to not clearly identifying the end-users or their needs. This often results in products or solutions that do not meet user expectations ([Standish Group, 2020](https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/CHAOSReport2015-Final.pdf)).
- A survey conducted by McKinsey & Company found that 70% of employees felt their work was not aligned with the company's strategic goals, indicating a widespread issue of tasks being carried out without a clear understanding of their purpose within the broader organizational context ([McKinsey & Company, 2018](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/the-organization-blog/aligning-employees-with-the-companys-strategic-goals)).
- Gartner reported that 20% of project budgets are typically wasted due to inefficiencies in task management and misalignment with project goals ([Gartner, 2019](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3873863/the-2019-gartner-project-management-benchmarks)).
- An article by Harvard Business Review highlights that organizations often miss out on strategic opportunities because they are bogged down with tasks that do not contribute to their long-term objectives ([Harvard Business Review, 2019](https://hbr.org/2019/03/why-so-many-strategic-initiatives-fail)).
- According to Gallup, only 35% of U.S. employees are engaged in their work, often due to a lack of clarity and purpose in their daily tasks. This low engagement is directly linked to unclear task objectives and misalignment with overall goals ([Gallup, 2020](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/321965/employee-engagement-holds-steady-first-half-2020.aspx)).

Despite knowing that certain tasks may be inefficient or ineffective, people often continue to engage in these activities due to a combination of cognitive limitations, biases, social influences, and organizational dynamics. Herbert Simon's concept of bounded rationality explains that individuals make decisions within the constraints of limited information and cognitive capabilities, often resulting in satisfactory rather than optimal choices ([Simon, 1955](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1884852)). Daniel Kahneman's research on cognitive biases reveals that people frequently rely on intuitive (System 1) thinking, which is prone to errors such as overconfidence, anchoring, and framing effects ([Kahneman, 2011](https://www.farrarstrausgiroux.com)). Piers Steel's work on procrastination indicates that individuals often delay or avoid tasks perceived as difficult or unpleasant, contributing to inefficiency ([Steel, 2007](https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.65)). Furthermore, Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert Sutton highlight the "knowing-doing gap," where organizations fail to translate knowledge into action due to lack of clear objectives, bureaucratic inertia, and misaligned incentives ([Pfeffer & Sutton, 2000](https://hbr.org/product/the-knowing-doing-gap-how-smart-companies-turn-knowledge-into-action/1408E-KND-ENG)). Social pressures and the desire to conform also play a significant role, as individuals may undertake tasks to align with perceived expectations rather than objective efficiency. These factors collectively explain why inefficiency and ineffectiveness persist in both individual and organizational behaviors.

## 3. The ActivityZen Method

The ActivityZen Method revolves around three core questions that are designed to clarify (and enhance) the purpose and scope of any task. Having answers to these questions helps to improve the quality of task specifications, task assignment and task execution, and gives individuals more confidence that their efforts are directed towards actually meaningful and productive outcomes.

The questions are as follows:

1. "**What are the <u>concrete results</u> of the task?**"
2. "**Which (groups of) individual people will <u>actually</u> be using these results?**"
3. "**What is it that these people will <u>actually be doing</u> with the results?**"

### 3.1. Concrete results

Answers to the first question ("**What are the <u>concrete results</u> of the task?**") should identify the concrete artifacts that will exist when the task is done (and that did not exist at the start). They can be tangible artifacts, such as documents, reports, presentations, but also intangibles such as new ideas, or enjoyable memories.

Answers should identify concrete artifacts, the existence of which is verifiable (auditable). Creating 'a solid advice' may be the name of a task, but since the existence of 'a solid advice' isn't verifiable, it doesn't qualify as an answer to this question. 

Ideally, answers to this question also specify any verifiable (auditable) characteristics that the results are expected to have. For example, a report may require that a particular template be used, is written in a given language, have an appendix that contains a glossary of terms and/or abbreviations used, etc.

{{write a paragraph that summarizes the benefits of having a good answer to this question, and the risks one runs when the answer does not meet the qualifications mentioned above.}}

### 3.2. Actual users

Answers to the second question ("**Which (groups of) individual people will <u>actually</u> be using these results?**") should list the names of the individuals that will be using the results, and/or the names of a group of people, such as "Members of Parliament", for which it is clear who is, and who is not, a member. We will use the term 'consumers (of a result)' to refer to the set of individuals that will actually be using that result.

Answers should not refer to groups of individuals for which it cannot be established who is, and who is not a part of the group. For example, "the customer" or "readers" are not useful as an answer.

Note that consumers are individuals that will <u>*actually*</u> be using the results. There may be many other individuals that might <u>*potentially*</u> use the results, but these are not considered consumers. 

{{write a paragraph that summarizes the benefits of having a good answer to this question, and the risks one runs when the answer does not meet the qualifications mentioned above.}}

### 3.3. Fit-for-purposeness

Answers to the third question ("**What is it that these people will <u>actually be doing</u> with the results?**") list the activities of every (group of) consumers for which the result is necessary.

Ideally, answers to this question also elaborate on the particular characteristics of the results that make it particularly valuable for being used in specific activities. 

{{write a paragraph that summarizes the benefits of having a good answer to this question, and the risks one runs when the answer does not meet the qualifications mentioned above.}}

### 3.4. When and where to use the method

These questions may be answered in a number of situations. 
- whenever a task is designed. By answering these questions, the designer of the task can {{elaborate}}.
- whenever a person is tasked with the execution of a task. By answering these questions, that person {{elaborate}}.
- whenever a person has been executing a task from some time (some tasks take a long time). By answering these questions, that person {{elaborate}}.
- whenever a task is being evaluated for efficiency and effectiveness. By answering these questions, the person that evaluates that {{elaborate}}. 

## 4. Benefits of the ActivityZen Method

{{rewrite this entire chapter, only using sections when there is sufficient contents for it (currently, the contents for each is some 2 sentences, which doesn't warrant them to be a section. Link the benefits to the reasons for people to behave inefficient/ineffective, and do some text that shows how the answers to the questions might contribute to their coming to grips with that, and become more efficient/effective/communucative/relevant/etc.)}}
